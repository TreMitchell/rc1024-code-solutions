## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  extracting properties directly into variables
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  const {property1: variable1, property2: variable2, ... } = object;
- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  const [value1, value2, value3, ... ] = variable;
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  When destructuring object/array literals, you are unpacking properties or elements into individual variables while creating literals is just defining those properties and elements.
