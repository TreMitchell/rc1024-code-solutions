## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is a set of statements that perform tasks or calculates a value.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  These consist of four things: the function keyword followed by the name of the function, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas, and the JS/TS statements that define the function in curly braces.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function is being called when you write the name of the function and place () next to it and even parameters inside of the parentheses if necessary.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A function call is when you call the defined function to output the function while a function definition is when you are defining what you want your function to call.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  Parameters are when we define a function with some keyword that will be used and an argument is when we call on that function with a keyword which will be used within our console to get our desired output.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters are useful because it prevents us from passing incorrect data types towards the function.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Return causes the function to produce a value we can use in the program and prevents any more code in the code block from being run.
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  This is the syntax for defining an arrow function: const variable = (parameters) => implicit return
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  There isn't going to be a return statement and there is only one line of code.
