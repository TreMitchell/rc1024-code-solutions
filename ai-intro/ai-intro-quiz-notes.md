  your answer: The best way to use AI tools when learning software development is when you are having any difficulties on certain lines of code and when you need clarification on any concepts the developer is learning.

  comparison: Pretty similar, but the AI explained it in more detailed.
- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  your answer: A danger of using AI tools for software development is you are too reliant on the AI and use it for solutions on exercises.
